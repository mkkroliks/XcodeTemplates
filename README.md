## How to import all code snippets to Xcode
All Xcode code snippets exist as a .plist files in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/ . If CodeSnippets folder does not exists, create it on your own. You can simply copy all code snippets (.codesnippet) into this folder, restart Xcode and you should have all of them ready to use.
